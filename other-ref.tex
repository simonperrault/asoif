Results from this paper:
1- abstraction should come with reduced cognitive cost

==> calm technology: thermal feedback is a bit slower, and may thus be less distracting that a strong vibration
==> distinguishability, in that case we aim for recognizability: it matters more than people are able to accurately recognize the pattern

Representational mapping: e.g. encoding direction with spatially distinct actuators (e.g. west vs. left), which improves learnability

On the other hand, list of dimensions discussed, e.g. wave, frequency, rythm do not apply due to the different nature of thermal feedback and latency. We decided to go for single values for these dimensions.
Only common dimension is location, which we leverage for some scenarios.

Most previous work do provide abstract patterns, and we follow this direction (OmniVib, Yatani, etc...)

Discusses duration, magnitude, frequency, delays
==> all of that is controlled in our case

Most of metaphors could be applied to some extent:
Discuss about hot vs. cold sensation, hot conveys notion of urgency, and feels less comfortable,

Note: design of multimodal haptic icons is out of scope for this research.

Says that people can identify simple "lines" (e.g. vertical, etc...) but cannot recognize complex objects. Only experts can do complex objects. This advocates for simpler patterns (with one or two actuators) to maximize recognizability.

Simple Dimensions:
Frequency
Amplitude - needs to be set, and may cause pain
Waveform - Hard to do given latency
Duration - Controlled, suggest to use shorter (simpler) patterns for frequent notifications to maximize recognizability and time

Complex dimensions:
Rythm - similar issue
Complex waveform - cannot
Spatial location - can

Note: the rest of the experiments is out of scope (rythm and stuff)
Used roughhness for priority ~ temperature change?
Actually chunking by Miller 1956 lah
rhythm for distinct applications

Force feedback with dimensions we cannot control
This paper suggests that two dimensions seem to give the best results, so advocate to stick to two among (temperature vs. trend vs. location)
